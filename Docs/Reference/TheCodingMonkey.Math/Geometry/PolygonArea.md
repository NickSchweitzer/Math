# Geometry.PolygonArea method (1 of 2)

Calculates the area of a Polygon given an array of Points.

```csharp
public static double PolygonArea(this IList<Point> points)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| points | Points which define the vertices of the polygon. |

## Return Value

A double representing the area inside the polygon.

## Remarks

The polygon is assumed to be closed, with the last point in the array not being the same as the first point in the array.

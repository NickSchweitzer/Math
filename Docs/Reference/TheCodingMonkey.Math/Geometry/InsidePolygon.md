# Geometry.InsidePolygon method (1 of 2)

Determines whether a given point is inside a polygon defined by a list of points

```csharp
public static bool InsidePolygon(this Point testPoint, IList<Point> polygon)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| testPoint | Test Point |
| polygon | List of points which define the boundaries of the polygon |

## Return Value

True if *testPoint* is in *polygon*. False otherwise.

## Remarks

The polygon is assumed to be closed, with the last point in the array not being the same as the first point in the array.

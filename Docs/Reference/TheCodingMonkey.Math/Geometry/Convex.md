# Geometry.Convex method (1 of 2)

Determines whether a polygon is considered Convex, where all interior angles are less than 180 degrees.

```csharp
public static bool? Convex(this IList<Point> points)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| points | List of points which define the boundaries of the polygon |

## Return Value

True if the polygon is Convex, false if it is Concave, and null if it cannot be computed.

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentException | Thrown if the IList of points contains fewer than three elements. |

## Remarks

The polygon is assumed to be closed, with the last point in the array not being the same as the first point in the array.

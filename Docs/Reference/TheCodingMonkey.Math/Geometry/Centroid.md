# Geometry.Centroid method (1 of 2)

Calculates the center of gravity for a Polygon given an array of Points.

```csharp
public static PointF Centroid(this IList<Point> points)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| points | Points which define the vertices of the polygon. |

## Return Value

The Point which represents the center of gravity.

## Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentException | Thrown if the IList of points contains fewer than three elements. |

## Remarks

The polygon is assumed to be closed, with the last point in the array not being the same as the first point in the array. This method assumes the polygon has a homogeneous density.

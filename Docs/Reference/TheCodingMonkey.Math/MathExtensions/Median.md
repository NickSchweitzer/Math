# MathExtensions.Median method (1 of 4)

Calculates the Median of all the passed in values.

```csharp
public static decimal Median(this IEnumerable<decimal> items)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| items | IEnumerable of items to calculate the average of |

## Return Value

Median value of all the items in the list

## Remarks

The median is the value seperating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample. If there are an even number of values in the list, such that an exact center can't be determined, then the average of the two middle numbers is returned.
